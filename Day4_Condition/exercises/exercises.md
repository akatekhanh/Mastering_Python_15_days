Here are some exercises you can do to practice using conditional statements in Python:

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then prints whether the number is even or odd.
2. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and then prints the larger of the two.
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a grade between 0 and 100, and then prints the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) according to the following scale:
    - A: 90-100
    - B: 80-89
    - C: 70-79
    - D: 60-69
    - F: below 60
4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a year, and then prints whether the year is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.
