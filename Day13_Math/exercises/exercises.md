Write a program that calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere with a given radius. The program should prompt the user to enter the radius of the sphere and output the volume and surface area rounded to 2 decimal places.

To solve this exercise, you can use the following formulas:

Volume of a sphere: `4/3 * pi * r**3`
Surface area of a sphere: `4 * pi * r**2`
